The text edition of every card is very straightforward, just paste Name/Type/Core text in the respective places, same with the power numbers, 
for the Lore text, since these have a special spacing, is better to have the text in a paragraph of 7 to 8 words, at the moment of changing 
the text, it will keep the same space between lines. 

Placing the art should be easy for anyone too, just put the images as the last in the list of elements and change the size to fit in the 
art window, make visible the card background (frame color), same with the mana icons and number, and should be ready to export. 

These files were created by thinking that the Saito community could create their own designs for Realms, custom cards that could be added after
review (due balance), so it should be easy to edit and straightforward to understand. If it's necessary we can upload a video of the process of 
creating a card from scratch.
